    "## Materialization 101\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will attempt to _materialize_ an RDFS graph with deep learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "An RDFS graph is a multigraph, that is, a collection of nodes with edges and labels, out of which there could be multiple outgoing edges from a single node, that has a specific _semantics_.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to understand the semantics of RDFS, we ought to first have a look at how the data really looks like.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data-format wise, it is usually stored with the file extension `.nt` in a very simple format: one triple per line.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two parts of an RDFS graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first is the _TBOX_, the ontology, that is, the set of nodes that encodes the hierarchy of the graph:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "(employee, rdf:type, Class)\n",
    "(faculty, rdfs:subClassOf, employee)\n",
    "(professor, rdfs:subClassOf, faculty)\n",
    "(teaches, rdf:type, rdf:Property)\n",
    "(lectures, rdfs:subPropertyOf, teaches)\n",
    "(teaches, rdfs:domain, professor)\n",
    "(course, rdf:type, Class)\n",
    "(teaches, rdfs:range, course)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exemplary graph, we define that *employee* is a _Class_, *faculty* is a _type_ of *employee*, *professor* is a _subClass_ of *faculty*, *teaches* is a _type_ of _property_, *lectures* is a _subProperty_ of *teaches*, and that *teaches* is in the _domain_ of *professor*, alongside with *course*, a _Class_, is in the _range_ of *teaches*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next up we have the _ABOX_, which is where we will make assertions about individuals with the rules we've defined on the _TBOX_.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "(professor1, lectures, course1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can talk about materialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "RDFS has a set of _entailment_ rules which dictate its _semantics_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are they(the ones that matter, for now):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ":A(?y, rdf:type, ?x) :- :T(?a, rdfs:domain, ?x), :A(?y, ?a, ?z) . // 1\n",
    ":A(?z, rdf:type, ?x) :- :T(?a, rdfs:range, ?x), :A(?y, ?a, ?z) . // 2\n",
    ":T(?x, rdfs:subPropertyOf, ?z) :- :T(?x, rdfs:subPropertyOf, ?y), :T(?y, rdfs:subPropertyOf, ?z) . // 3\n",
    ":T(?x, rdfs:subClassOf, ?z) :- :T(?x, rdfs:subClassOf, ?y), :T(?y, rdfs:subClassOf, ?z) . // 4\n",
    ":A(?x, ?b, ?y) :- :T(?a, rdfs:subPropertyOf, ?b), :A(?x, ?a, ?y) . // 5\n",
    ":A(?z, rdf:type, ?y) :- :T(?x, rdfs:subClassOf, ?y), :A(?z, rdf:type, ?x) . // 6\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The way to read a rule is quite straightforward.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, `:T(?x, rdfs:subClassOf, ?z) :- :T(?x, rdfs:subClassOf, ?y), :T(?y, rdfs:subClassOf, ?z) .` is spelled as: If the tbox triples (?x, rdfs:subClassOf, ?y)\n",
    "and (?y, rdfs:subClassOf, ?z) exist in the tbox, then (?x, subClassOf, ?z) *must* exist in the tbox as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "To _materialize_ an RDFS graph, means adding all triples which *must* exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, materializing the given _TBOX_ yields the following triples to be added:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "(faculty, rdfs:type, Class)\n",
    "(professor, rdf:type, Class)\n",
    "(professor, rdfs:subClassOf, employee)\n",
    "(lectures, rdf:type, rdf:Property)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And now for the _ABOX_, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "(professor1, rdf:type, professor)\n",
    "(course1, rdf:type, course)\n",
    "(professor1, teaches, course1)\n",
    "(professor1, rdf:type, faculty)\n",
    "(professor1, rdf:type, employee)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As it can be seen, there are is no more *knowledge* that can be inferred.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "We have 6 files under the folder `data`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`tiny_tbox.nt/ntenc` and `tiny_abox.nt/ntenc` are a small tbox and abox whose materialization could be verified by hand. the files with `ntenc` extension\n",
    "are the same as those with `nt`, except they are encoded with integers, taking far less space. This is something to keep in mind when dealing with large amounts of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "`real_abox.nt` and `real_tbox.nt` are actual data that are used to benchmark materialization engines, hence, we could fit the same data, after materialization, into other\n",
    " reasoners in order to verify that what we are doing is correct."
